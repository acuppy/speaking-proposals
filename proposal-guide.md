## Proposal Guide

Developing a solid proposal for any conference comes down to a few core
principles and a few recommended practices.

Regardless of the conference, at its core, a good proposal has a...

*   Clear outcome
*   Clear target audience
*   A compelling narrative
*   The reason why you're the right speaker for your topic (the pitch)

Most conferences follow a similar proposal structure:

*   Abstract
*   Description
*   Pitch

Conferences, such as Codeland, have a more comprehensive proposal submission
structure, but even in their situation, the structure is meant to tease out the
same talk details listed above.

### Abstract

300 - 600 characters (1 - 3 paragraphs)

Your abstract should be highly-engaging and have a compelling hook: it should
"sell your talk." It's critical to remember that an abstract is likely the
only summary a conference attendee will have, and for that reason, it's in the
best interest of the conference organizer(s) to make sure this excites/engages
their attendees.

In a concise way, the abstract should answer these three questions:

1.  Who is the target audience?
1.  What will this talk teach you?
1.  What problem is this talk tackling?

### Description

500 - 1200 words

An extension of the abstract, the description is a _reasonably_ detailed
breakdown of the talk mechanics (live coding, audience participation, slides,
etc.) and a more detailed breakdown of how you plan to address each chunk of
your abstract. This is entirely for the organizers, and not made public to the
attendees.

Pay close attention to what information the organizers do or do _not_ want in
included.  This can be a common oversight if you're submitting the same talk to
many conferences. As an example: RubyCentral, who organizes RailsConf and
RubyConf as that description _exclude_ personally identifying information. While
others ask specifically for past speaking experiences and/or examples. Watch out
for github.com repos and/or YouTube videos of past speaking engagements.  In
either situation, you many be identifying yourself.

As Justin Searls does in his talk proposal "Workflows," in a situation where you
feel this information helps build a case for why your talk is valuable for their
audience, prepend the source with "(warning: identifying information)" to give
the choice to the organizers.

#### What's the flow of the talk?

Walk through the talk journey for the attendee; a beginning, middle and end. In
theatre we call this the "story arc."

**Beginning**

In a theatrical context, the beginning would include all the exposition:
characters, environment, and themes.  In a talk, we do something similar:

Characters: _Who are you? and what about your experience (or lack of) qualifies
  you?_

Environment: _What's the problem and it's context (e.g.,
  technical environment)? and... How do you know that it's a problem?_

Themes: _Will there be slides, live-coding, group participation, etc...?_

**Middle**

Building a case is the next step. Again, for a theatrical context, we call this
"rising action" where the characters will use various tactics to achieve their
objective. (This is where all the drama comes in and problem becomes obvious.)

_What's a plausible solution? and... What experience have you had or researched
that supports that solution?_

**End/Conclusion**

Every story ends with a resolution and implied or explicit "call to action;" and
so will our talk.  When I was in acting school, my teacher told us, the audience
should always leave feeling compelled to do something, and at the very least,
feel something profound.

While we won't achieve this 100% of the time, it's a good target to have. Now,
that doesn't mean the "something" is mountain moving or earth shattering.
Instead, think of it as a specific take away; something that could be acted on
tomorrow (figuratively speaking) and compel the audience into a considering
another approach now or in the future. So...

_What's the call to action? and... what can be done tomorrow (figuratively
speaking) to make a positive change in the attendees life?_

### Pitch

2 - 3 paragraphs

Why this? Why now? Why you? (in this order)

I've found this section to harbor the meat and potatoes of every talk. A friend
of mine (Nadia Odunayo - @nodunayo) brought to my attention that what I wrote in
the Pitch for "Difficult Conversations" was my actual Abstract.

The motivation, heart and passion to give this talk is often found in this one
section, and for that reason, cannot be undervalued or overlooked.

Regardless, tell the organizers _why_ and show your passion for it. Don't throw
this away with message to the organizers or some trivial 'just because' like
statement. This is your moment to really hit on what _compelled_ you to help
other developers through the problem/solution you're speaking about.

Make it rich and full of you.
