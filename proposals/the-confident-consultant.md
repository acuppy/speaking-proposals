## The Confident Consultant

### Abstract

So, you did it. You took the leap, quit your job and are now out on your own... oh god. I bet you have a lot of questions. _What should be in my contracting agreement? Do I need insurance? How much should I charge? How do I market?_

We get it, you don't know what you don't know. And you don't know who you can ask (without feeling stupid). This panel discussion is with four consultants who have each been in business for more than five years. They're going to tackle the most critical topics to consider in year one.

### Description

I've compiled a list of over a dozen consultants/consultancy operators to participate.  I do need to confirm which of them will be attending RailsConf, but all of which have been in business and profitable for more than five years. They've all offered to provide feedback and speak openly, but again, I need to confirm each of them.

The talk will be 70% predetermined questions (see below) and 30% audience Q/A. The focus is on the first year in business, not much beyond that. The goal is to help identify what is most important and what advice would be helpful in that first year. It will be heavily moderated by myself, to protect run-on questions or answers.

Example questions:

- Looking back, what is one piece of advice you would have given yourself before you started consulting?

- What are the top three things you would “have in place” during your first 90 days as a consultant?

- Are there any online course, books or other resources that you recommend the most to new consultants starting out?

- Do you recall the moment when you decided to “go out on your own?” If so, can you explain what happened?

- What was one thing you underestimated the importance of before you started?

- Do you recall setting any initial goals (e.g., income per year, clients of a certain size, etc.)? Did you hit those goals initially?

- Was there any advice that you were given in the first 90 days that set you up for success later in business?

- What was the recurring/flat rate of your first consulting project? How did you set that price?

- What was your selling point to new clients/companies? Did you sell on ability, quality, team, vision?

- Did you know your first client personally? If so, what were some of those dynamics (e.g., coworkers from a previous job, long time friends, etc.)?

- Were you in a committed relationship at the time, and if so, is there any advice you can give to someone in a similar situation?

- What was one or two beliefs you had about being an independent consultant, and did either/both come to be true?

- What is something that you expected to happen quickly that took much longer?

- Did you have any outside income when you started (e.g., spousal income, family support, investments, savings, etc.)?

- Other than doing the work, what is one area that you would put a majority of your focus into (e.g., inbound sales, outbound marketing, etc.)? 

### Pitch

When I started consulting over five years ago, I was scared to death. I'd heard horror stories of being taken advantage of and/or being underprepared as a business. Had I not taken the mentorship of many in our community, I might have failed. When I started offering up my time as a mentor to new consultants, I found that many of their questions were basic, and helped alleviate a lot of uncertainty. 

I've been in the process of producing a guide for new consultants that help guide through the first stages of business.  This is a reflection of some of that work.
