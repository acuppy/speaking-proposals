## Yes! And..

### Abstract

What happens when we drop "No, but..." from our daily interactions or life choices in favor of the #1 rule of improv: Yes, and..?

This talk is not a technical deep dive into the Ruby VM or a walk-through of a new gem. I won't touch on testing strategies or war stories as a developer. Instead, I'm going to teach you improv.

We'll call it a social strategy for an awesome life! This talk is for introverts and extroverts alike. You won't be brought onstage (unless you want to be).

### Description

This "talk" is more an interactive journey. While the structure of the talk is essentially an improv class for non-performers, I will be relating the lessons of improv back to use on a team of people.

- Yes, and...
- Listen to respond
- Everything becomes fact
- Go all out

The flow of the talk is meant to engage in an easy and low-risk way and build up from there. The goal is that everyone should feel empowered to re-engage their teams and create opportunities to explore new ideas.

- Elements of a "Safe environment"
- "Yes! And.." Fail
- "Yes! And.." Build
- "Yes! And.." Share
- C.R.O.W. (Character, Relationship, Objective, Where)
- The "Yes! And..." Mindset

Within the  "Yes! And..." sections there are exercises/improvs that can be taken back to their teams. 

The closing element is a downloadable guide of improvs they can use with their team.

### Pitch

I've been an actor for ~20 years and improv is one of the first classes you take; it's essential education.

For any group of team members being willing/able to roll with the punches and work with what you get can keep the flow of progress going. I've used the lessons of improv to meet new people and let go of my preconceptions around how I need to act.

Improv is an exceptional way to even the playing field, because we all look stupid, and the result is an open mind and slew of energy.
