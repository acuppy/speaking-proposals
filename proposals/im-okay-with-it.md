UNDER DEVELOPMENT

### Title
I’m okay with it.

### Abstract

As you know, you’re not the code you write, but you are the time you spent on it.  For years, I burned the midnight oil, ate dinner at my desk, slept on a couch, kissed my spouse goodnight to be at my desk in the morning. I dedicated my time to being exceptional at everything, but what mattered in life: living.

I’m going to be a father soon, and it got me thinking: What is my time worth? What do I want to be, truly, great at?

I've written more code that's never seen the light of day, than code that has.  That's not because I couldn't finish it, or that my work wasn't valued. It's because I decided it wasn't worth my time. There are 86,400 seconds in a day. When one ticks away, I'll never have it back, so I'm going to use it on what I care to be good at. For everything else, I’ve decided to suck at it.

I’m going to walk through my strategies for caring more about less; for making decisions more quickly; and letting go of what might work, but isn’t work

While my time, like yours, is a limited resource, living life is the longest thing I'll ever do. As a software developer, I spent countless nights burning my eyes out, eating lunch/d

I've never been great at everything, but I've always tried to be.
