## Four Ingredients

### Abstract

Sugar, tea, starter culture, and time. That’s all it takes to brew kombucha; that sour, bubbly drink with weird floaties. For thousands of years, people across the planet have been consuming this seemingly simple concoction. However, I found the process of brewing the “booch” more representative that just yummy.

Like many challenges in life, we can look to nature to guide our hand. This talk explores the five components of fermentation and a simple recipe for building a healthy culture. You see, while the ingredients may be similar, it’s the process that fosters the result.

### Details

More often than not, people are more evolved than the teams they’re on. It’s easy to lose sight of how a culture develops. As individuals, we’ve been “in-development” for many years (decades!) but we forget and expect our teams to change and evolve overnight - it just doesn’t work that way; time is a critical component.

However, time isn’t the only thing. There are four other factors that have a radical impact on the result of any culture:

**Growing a Culture: 101**

- Stable Environment
- Compositional Understanding
- Objective Analysis
- Nourishment
- Time

It’s true. I learned a lot about people and team development while brewing many gallons of kombucha. What struck me was how a few ingredients can create such a valued drink; but that without the proper expectations it can go wildly wrong.

This talk is a parable. It looks at how we, as people and as a group, evolve. It explores our expectations from a macro-level. It welcomes the idea that while not every culture is the same, every culture shares common traits; and that missing any one of the five points above can lead to a path of acidity and disease.

### Pitch

Human beings need community. We need a home and to have “a place.” As a team leader I’ve seen this need emerge over and over again and when it’s not meet with acceptance, it turns acidic and emotionally cancerous. When I started brewing kombucha a few key insights about company culture hit me: stability, understanding, analysis, nourishment and time. Teams, like a culture are resilient, but with a few missteps can be rocked to pieces. 

I applied them to everything we did as a company and started to see happier faces. We discovered what we were missing and put our attention improving those areas.

I bring this topic to the conference because every community needs perspective to avoid being afraid of time and change.  This talk is about the five intentions that can correct course and support everyone.
