## The Show Must Go On

### Abstract

60 actors. 50 crew. 3 Directors. 1000 audience members. Only one opening night.

It's a little mind-boggling: How do dozens of creatives come together and, without fail, produce, rehearse and prepare for one single deadline: opening night. On the surface, live theatre is one large waterfall project, but in reality, it's agile at its finest. 

In this talk I'll walk through the practices that we can use as developers to make sure, the show goes on.

### Description

In theatre we all know, when opening night is set, the curtain will rise and the show will start. That deadline is not optional.

For anyone who's been in theatre you know that you start with a grand vision and as you put the cast together and the bits and pieces are realized, collaborative compromise is a must and creative priority is essential.

Theatre is a dance with the audience. We make assumptions as creatives and actors that we test through rehearsal and previews. 

The agile nature of theatre is that your intentions are set in the beginning, and through collaboration, you work through the mechanics of realizing the vision.

This talk is walk through of the production process: preparation, initial creative assumptions, iteration and collaboration as a creative team, setting expectations with the cast and crew, and trimming creative scope to stay focused on the essentials to relay the story.

Note: This talk may be presented in collaboration with a member of the La Jolla Playhouse staff.

### Pitch

Deadlines are easily seen as a hindrance to great software; I don't think that's true.

I've been a semi-professional actor for ~20 years and I'm amazed at the consistency of the opening night deadline; yes, some shows open more ready than others, but in larger production companies (Oregon Shakespeare Festival) they have a process of collaboration that protects opening night, allows for iteration afterwards, and guarantees the show goes on.

I'd love to share that cross-industry knowledge
