## Cult(ure)

Accepted: GORUCO 2016 (Keynote)

Rejected: RailsConf 2017

### Abstract

Like I’ve mentioned, I’ve been a professional actor for more than 20 years. Understanding the physical side of human emotion is part of the craft. Further, I studied NLP (Neuro-linguistic Programming) over the last 10 years and run workshops with teams of as little as 4 and as large as a few hundred. For the last four years, I’ve been a business owner of a team close to 20.

Why this talk, now?

I see/talk/listen to so many people that are afraid to connect, out of the fear of confrontation. We text/Slack/email all in place of face-to-face conversation. We allow “introvert” to explain why we’re not comfortable asking for what we need when most of the time it just comes down to being afraid of saying why we need it.

Anyone - and I do mean anyone - can be exactly who they are, changing nothing about themselves, and foster a more heartfelt connection to those around them. Contrary to popular belief: Empathy is not earned - it’s created.

“Your company culture is your operating system” - Dave Gray (@davegray)

The talk is broken into four parts:

-   The source of cult-like behavior;
-   The downward spiral of fear-based control;
-   The ideal company culture promised land; and,
-   The questions to ask yourself to avoid the trap.

Below are a few short snippets from each section:

**Source**

Tony Robbins identified “Six Human Needs” that we, as people, consistently work to fulfill: Certainty, Uncertainty, Significance, Love & Connection, Growth, and Contribution. How we pursue these needs varies, and we get fulfillment from all areas of our life - positive *and negative*.

**Downward Spiral**

You see, although we are inspired by *pleasure*, we are ultimately driven by *pain*; the pain which comes from the *fear* we won’t feel pleasure. This feeling is experienced by both the leadership and the team members. As leaders, we are often empowered (and encouraged) to manage the people we oversee. When you combine *fear* and *authority* the answer is often to constrain and control.

**Promised Land**

Developing a company culture is an organic evolutionary process. Each member of the team (leaders included) are like colored pencils: each color is unique and specific, yet each pencil shares a common function - to create art. The more the options, the more dynamic the artwork; and with each new color, the pool of options grows, exponentially.

The answer is not to constrain the diversity, but to embrace it, encourage it, and empower it to solve new, huge problems.

“Leaders” ultimately, are an organization’s test suite, not it’s implementation. Leaders assess if the actions being taken are working to fulfill the core values of the organization, or are out of alignment. As a team, there is a fine line between sharing values and enforcing conformity; leaders assess the former.

**Question to Ask**

As a team, we have one “convening question:”
*How can we bring the most value to ourselves, our team, our community, and our company?*

As an individual, this is an evolving list, but as a company, we’ve landed on:

1.  Are both leaders and members empowered to effect change?
2.  Are leaders and members held accountable, equally?
3.  Are members punished for asking “why?”
4.  Are *you* fulfilling your own needs?
5.  Do your core values align with the organization?

### Pitch

**Why this Topic**

This is not a talk about ethnic diversity, which is being very well covered by some amazing speakers. This talk tackles the functional site of cultural diversity; as in, how to function and/or lead in a manner that supports the inclusion and empowerment of a team. As I/we consult growing organizations, there appears to be a natural progression towards controlling the dynamic of a team by disempowering the team and relegating accountability to a higher power.

**Why me**

Before I an engineer and consultancy owner, I was the Creative Director for a $200M, 4,000 employees, 200 location coffee company. Company culture was everything; it was the product. My job was primarily to articulate how could replicate the cultural success of one location to another, as the company grew.

These are the same strategies I/we used to fully empower our team to be *their* definition of amazing. Our team is very tight and very enthusiastic. I’ve never been more proud. I want to share what we did, that works.
