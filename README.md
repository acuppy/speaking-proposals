## Speaking Proposals

In this repository you'll find an complete list of speaking proposals that I've
submitted to various conferences around the world.  This list includes talks
that have been accepted, rejected and/or waitlisted.

### Why?

I give between 8 - 12 conference talks a year, all over the world. Similarly,
I've audited talk submissions for conferences such as RailsConf and Codeland,
and over time found that many new submitters are unfamiliar with how to write
and structure a proposal...

The goal of this repository is to help provide insight into the submission
process and proposal structure.

### What feedback?

I'm more than happy to provide insight or support on a proposal. If you'd like
help, please follow this guide...

1. Review my [proposal guide][prop-guide]
1. Write your proposal as a new [Gist][gist]
1. Open an [Issue][issues] with a link to your Gist
1. Give me between 3 - 5 days to review

_Please note, I don't not provide feedback on the talk concept itself, just the
proposal structure and if the components of your proposal seem coherent, clear
and well presented. Most importantly, I'm only one person, and as always, I
recommend you get feedback from at least one other person._
